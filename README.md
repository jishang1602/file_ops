# file Operation in C 

* The assignments for the file operation

* Open and read a file of integers into an array that is created with the first integer telling you how many to read.

* So  4  9  11  12  15  would mean create an int array size 4 and read in the remaining 4 values into data[].

* Then compute their average as a double and their max  as an int.  Print all this out neatly to the screen and to an output file named answer-hw3.txt-hw3.

* Solution for the program

* main.c is the main file for the file operation as per suggested in the assignment. we have also created the file inputdata.txt as suggested in the statement

* to run the main.c please use the below command in the Linux / DOS based system.

* git clone https://github.com/jishang1602/file_ops.git
* cd file_ops/
* gcc main.c 
* ./a.out 
* File open sucessfully
* Element 0: 9
* Element 1: 11
* Element 2: 15
* Element 3: 12
* Average - 11.750000 and MAX - 15

* also creates the answer-hw3.txt

* To view the the file answer-hw3.txt .please use the below command
* cat answer-hw3.txt
